/**
 * @brief Class representing a contour composed of multiple segments.
 *
 * Contour is a copyable and moveable class and holds a vector of segments, anticipate support more segment types in the
 * future. This class provides methods to add, insert, and remove segments. It also provides a method to check if the
 * contour is valid (i.e., all segments are connected sequentially) and caches the result of the isValid() method to
 * improve performance.
